# Hand Gesture Recognition: Neural Network for Finger Gesture Prediction

## Overview
This project involves building a neural network that can recognize hand gestures representing numbers (0-5). The model is trained using a dataset of hand images showing various finger gestures, and it predicts the corresponding number. The trained model is then tested using personal images of hand gestures in a Jupyter notebook.

## Features
- **Train a Model**: The neural network is trained using a dataset of hand gestures corresponding to the digits 0-5.
- **Make Predictions**: The trained model can predict numbers from images of hand gestures.
- **Test with Personal Images**: After training, the model can be tested with images of your own hand gestures to classify the number being displayed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
